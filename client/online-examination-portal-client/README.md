## Overview
The Online examination portal helps examiners to take objective examinations and students to attend those exams. It has two separate profiles for examiners and students. 
Examiners can create, read, update and delete the examinations (CRUD operations), examiners can also create exams by uploading excel sheets, and can view the scores of exams taken by the student.
Students can view all the exams, register and attend those exams. Students can attend the exams multiple times and view their performance on each exam in the ‘results’ tab. It has a timer which is set by the examiner and the timer goes off the exam and gets submitted automatically.
